# Doug's Doomsday Counter

### this was made specifically for a friend of mine to count up till the next disaster at his office.
### it was made using flipclock...super awesome jquery library for counter.  

### clone down, npm install, kick up a server, and enjoy.  But really it took 5 seconds to do this so, no reason anyone should need to clone this down, but if you feel so inclined...rock it!!!
